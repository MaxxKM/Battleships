Battleships is a Python terminal game which run in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Battleships is a board game in which the player tries to destroy the other players ships first.

## How to play

Battleships is a board game that uses a grid that can vary in size. 

Each player has a set amount of ships they place on their grid(ships can also vary in size and shape), hidden from the other player.

Each player takes a turn to guess a row and column to take a shot.

If they hit the other players ship they mark it as hit and vice versa.

The player to destroy all the other's ships, wins. 

### My Version

In my version, the player plays against the computer on a 5x5 grid.

Each player has 4 ships that occupy one space and are randomly placed.

The player can see his own placement of his ships marked with '@'

Whenever the player guesses, his hits will be marked with 'X' and misses with 'O' on the computers board and vice versa.

The player keeps guessing until they hit all the computers ships or vice versa.
